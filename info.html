        <h3>Game:</h3>
            <p>As said on the home page, this game is a top down recreation of galaga with a bit of our twist (for playgerism reasons).
                <br> we began with a concept and a mock-up sketch for the game and worked from there. We started by creating a repository
                <br> with multiple brances so it wouldnt break if we messed it up (hint: it still broke... alot.). We started with coding the website and adding multiple pages to it.
                <br>We then coded the different pages and added a place holder for the game. Our home page provides our game which is currently under develoment, instructions for the
                <br> game, and basic information about the game. Our information page which goes in depth on our project and little bit out how we made the game. And the final page 
                <br> about us, which gives information about our team. 
                <br>
                <br> The game is a concept of galaga with a moddern twist. now the game on this web page is still in its very early stages but we will continue to work on it and make
                <br> it better than ever. We have basic controls and shooting machanics, we also have player anf enemy colision and we have entity deletion for of screen entitys.
                <br> We also have background art, a health bar for the player, and a score. like We said above this game is very limited due to time restraints but it will be full of
                <br>fun later on down the line.
