        <h3>Game:</h3>
            <p>As said on the home page, this game is a top down recreation of galaga with a bit of our twist (for playgerism reasons).<br> we began with a concept and a mock-up sketch for the game and worked from there. We started by creating a repository<br> with multiple brances so it wouldnt break if we messed it up (hint: it still broke... alot.). We started with coding the website and adding multiple pages to it.<br>We then coded the different pages and added a place holder for the game.</p>
